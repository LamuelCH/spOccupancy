spOccupancy fits single species, multispecies, and integrated spatial occupancy models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Models are fit using Polya-Gamma data augmentation. Spatial models are fit using either Gaussian processes or Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP) for large spatial datasets. Provides functionality for data integration of multiple single species occupancy data sets using a joint likelihood framework. 

## Installation

Coming soon!

<!--You can install the released version of `spOccupancy` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:-->

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
install.packages("spOccupancy")
```

<!--Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub, although note this will only work if you have the proper compilation tools, as the `C/C++` code must be compiled:-->
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('doserjef/spOccupancy')
```

## Example usage

### Load package and data

To get started with `spOccupancy` we load the package and an example data set. We use data on twelve foliage-gleaning birds from the [Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest](https://hubbardbrook.org/), which is available in the `spOccupancy` package as the `hbef2015` object. Here we will only work with one bird species, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (BTBW), and so we subset the `hbef2015` object to only include this species.

```{r}
library(spOccupancy)
data(hbef2015)
sp.names <- dimnames(hbef2015$y)[[1]]
btbwHBEF <- hbef2015
btbwHBEF$y <- btbwHBEF$y[sp.names == "BTBW", , ]
```

### Fit a spatial occupancy model using `spPGOcc`

Below we fit a single species spatial occupancy model to the BTBW data using a Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process. We use the default priors and starting values for the occurrence (`beta`) and regression (`alpha`) coefficients, the spatial variance (`sigma.sq`), the spatial range parameter (`phi`), the spatial random effects (`w`), and the latent occurrence values (`z`). We assume occurrence is a function of linear and quadratic elevation along with a spatial random intercept. We model detection as a function of linear and quadratic day of survey and linear time of day the survey occurred.

```{r}
# Specify model formulas
btbw.occ.formula <- ~ scale(Elevation) + I(scale(Elevation)^2)
btbw.det.formula <- ~ scale(day) + scale(tod) + I(scale(day)^2)
```

We run the model using an Adaptive MCMC sampler with a target acceptance rate of 0.43. We run the model for 10,000 iterations split into 400 batches each of length 25. We discard the first 2000 iterations as burn-in and use a thinning rate of 8 for a resulting 1000 samples from the joint posterior. We fit the model using 5 nearest neighbors and an exponential correlation function. We also specify the `k.fold` argument to perform 2-fold cross-validation after fitting the full model. 

```{r}
# Run the model
out <- spPGOcc(occ.formula = btbw.occ.formula,
               det.formula = btbw.det.formula,
               data = btbwHBEF, n.batch = 400, batch.length = 25,
               accept.rate = 0.43, cov.model = "exponential", 
               NNGP = TRUE, n.neighbors = 5, n.burn = 2000, 
               n.thin = 8, verbose = FALSE, k.fold = 2)
summary(out)
```

### Posterior predictive check

The function `ppcOcc` performs a posterior predictive check on the resulting list from the call to `spPGOcc`. For binary data, we first need to perform Goodness of Fit assessments on some binned form of the data rather than the raw binary data. Below we perform a posterior predictive check on the data grouped by site with a Freeman-Tukey fit statistic, and use the `summary` function to summarize the check with a Bayesian p-value.

```{r}
ppc.out <- ppcOcc(out, fit.stat = 'freeman-tukey', group = 1)
summary(ppc.out)
```

### Model selection using WAIC and k-fold cross-validation

The `waicOcc` function computes the Widely Applicable InformatioN Criterion (WAIC) for use in model selection and assessment. 

```{r}
waicOcc(out)
```

Alternatively, we can perform k-fold cross-validation directly in our call to `spPGOcc` using the `k.fold` argument and compare models using a deviance scoring rule. We fit the model with `k.fold = 4` and so below we access the devaince scoring rule from the 4-fold cross-validation. 

```{r}
out$k.fold.deviance
```

### Prediction

Out-of-sample prediction is possible using the `predict` function, a set of occurrence covariates at the new locations, and the spatial coordinates of the new locations. The object `hbefElev` contains elevation data across the entire Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Below we predict BTBW occurrence across the forest and plot the results using `ggplot2` and `stars`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First standardize elevation using mean and sd from fitted model
elev.pred <- (hbefElev$val - mean(btbwHBEF$occ.covs[, 1])) / sd(btbwHBEF$occ.covs[, 1])
coords.0 <- as.matrix(hbefElev[, c('Easting', 'Northing')])
X.0 <- cbind(1, elev.pred, elev.pred^2)
out.pred <- predict(out, X.0, coords.0, verbose = FALSE)
```
